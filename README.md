### Stage 1:
  - Get acquainted with NLTK
  - Process some text and check results

### Stage 2:
  - Design : how this bot is created
  - Submit Features

### Stage 3
  - Training the base model to have the ability to play chess with me
  
  - First train the model with the available datasets on chess and its moves.
  
  - Then using OpenCV watch the chess board and play chess realtime with me.
